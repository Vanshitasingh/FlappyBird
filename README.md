## Flappy Bird Game
It is a pygame implementation of the famous ‘Flappy Bird’ game, where the player dodges the obstacles as they appear on the screen.
The speciality of our project is that it uses AI to work up to 30 generations, restarting the game every time. The program runs the game automatically using artificial intelligence, no manual playing by user is required.
